		<p class="notes">this is a very simplistic approach to illustrating what i have been through; i didn't want to create a 500 page site to convey the ins and outs of my gender exploration. my journey to find myself is nowhere near over. every day brings about new opportunites and experiences that develop me as a person and bring me closer to my ideal. and while many of you have not had a similar experience to me, i believe that it is in everyone's best interest to strive to learn more about themselves and the world. thank you :&#41;</p>
